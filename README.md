FizzBuzz Refactoring Kata
=========================

The goal was to refactor the existing code so that adding the New feature is easy.

Existing
-----------

Multiples of 3 are "Fizz" and multiples of 5 are "Buzz".
The program stop when number reach 100.


New feature
-----------

In addition to Multiples of 3 being "Fizz" and multiples of 5 being "Buzz":

* Multiples of 7 are “Whizz”
* Multiples of 11 are “Bang”

That means for example that multiples of 3 & 7 are “FizzWhizz”, multiples of 5 & 11 are “BuzzBang” etc. 

* The program should continue to print out numbers beyond 100 and instead stop the first time you get “FizzBuzzWhizzBang”.
